# üêª -- FNaF in PyGame -- üêª
A simplified remake of the first FNaF game made by Scott Cawthon, but in Python! 

Unlike the original game, this game only has 1 night, 8 accessible cameras and 2 working animatronics.

Most of the animations are scrapped due to the time limit for the project.
# How to Run:
- Download all the files from the repository.
- Run the main.py file.
## Game Controls:
a  = Toggle left door

d = Toggle right door

s = Toggle camera

While the cameras are on, use the following keys to access a certain camera:
- 1 = Main Stage (Cam 1A)
- 2 = Dining Area (Cam 1B)
- 3 = West Hall (Cam 2A)
- 4 = West Hall Corner (Cam 2B)
- 5 = Backstage (Cam 3)
- 6 = East Hall (Cam 4a)
- 7 = East Hall Corner (Cam 4B)
- 8 = Restrooms (Cam 5)
